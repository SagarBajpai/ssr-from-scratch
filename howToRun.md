Simply run, `npm run dev:build:webpack` command in terminal. It will create a build folder in the root with one bundle.js file inside it.
Right now one build folder is already there as I have pushed the build folder too in the git.
To run the build, hit a command `node build/bundle.js`, server will start a PORT `3003` and you can see your first server side rendered react component. :)
